# Storj Uplink Library for Rust

This projects aims to build a Rust crate library for the [Storj Uplink Library](https://github.com/storj/uplink).

__THIS IS WIP__, there is not any estimation of time nor a commitment when this
Rust binding will have all the functionalities, so don't use it for any non-pet
project.

## Background

There is already a Rust binding [Storj Uplink Library](https://github.com/storj-thirdparty/uplink-rust)
which is auto-generated by [Rust Bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)
from the [official Storj Uplink C library](https://github.com/storj/uplink-c).

The result of Bindgen is a Rust binding which IS NOT IDIOMATIC and requires using
UNSAFE everywhere.

This crate offers an idiomatic and safe (you don't have to use the __unsafe__
keyword for using it) Rust crate library based on the Bindgen former.

## Implementation progress

Integration tests:

- [ ] Access Grant.
  - [ ] Create.
  - [ ] Request an Access Grant with passphrase.
  - [ ] Parse one.
  - [ ] Share one.
  - [ ] Override an encryption key of a specific Bucket and prefix.
- [ ] Project
  - [ ] Create a Bucket.
  - [ ] Try to create a Bucket which already exists.
  - [ ] Ensure a Bucket, an existing and non-existing one.
  - [ ] Stat a Bucket.
  - [ ] List Buckets.
  - [ ] Upload an Object.
  - [ ] Upload an Object with Custom Metadata.
  - [ ] Download an Object.
  - [ ] Stat an Object.
  - [ ] List Objects with and without System and Custom Metadata.
  - [ ] Delete an Object.
  - [ ] Delete an empty Bucket.
  - [ ] Delete a Bucket with objects.

General:

- [ ] Add general documentation about the Storj network and its entities mimicking the original [Go Uplink package](https://pkg.go.dev/storj.io/uplink#section-documentation).
- [ ] Add some documentation about the crate design and implementation if the documentation of each module, types, functions, etc., aren't enough.
