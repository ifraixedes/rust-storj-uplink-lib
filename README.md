# Storj Uplink Library for Rust

This projects aims to build a Rust crate library for the [Storj Uplink Library](https://github.com/storj/uplink).

__THIS IS WIP__, there is not any estimation of time nor a commitment when this
Rust binding will have all the functionalities, so don't use it for any non-pet
project.

## Background

There is already a Rust binding [Storj Uplink Library](https://github.com/storj-thirdparty/uplink-rust)
which is auto-generated by [Rust Bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)
from the [official Storj Uplink C library](https://github.com/storj/uplink-c).

The result of Bindgen is a Rust binding which IS NOT IDIOMATIC and requires using
UNSAFE everywhere.

This crate offers an idiomatic and safe (you don't have to use the __unsafe__
keyword for using it) Rust crate library based on the Bindgen former.
